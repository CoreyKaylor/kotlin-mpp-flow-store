# Description
This demonstrates using a kotlin multi-platform project with a redux-like store in Kotlin + SwiftUI using Flows and coroutines.

## Issues present
This is super early prototype work, but the sample is working with the caveat that it should repaint the view 3 times. Currently it updates only once at the end. I suspect it's likely a misunderstanding on my part in the coroutines piece.
